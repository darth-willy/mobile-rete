- These cases rely on datatype-related OWL2 RL rules, which require internal datatype support that is not available for all rule engines. Since these rules were left out, the following test cases needed to be removed:
	rdfbased-dat-crossdtype-instance-dtype
	rdfbased-dat-crossdtype-noinstance
	rdfbased-dat-dtype-*
	rdfbased-dat-crossdtype-instance-rdfsliteral
	rdfbased-ont-graph-form (also requires support for datatypes)

- Similarly, these tests rely on the character sets supported by rule engines. Since such support cannot be assumed in general, the following test cases were left out:
	rdfbased-ont-iri-ascii
	rdfbased-ont-iri-nonascii

- It is impractical to systematically test these cases, since they do not involve generating new inferences that can be compared to their expected output (also, they are trivially supported by any kind of rule engine):
	rdfbased-sem-simple-subgraph-self
	rdfbased-sem-simple-emptygraph-any
	rdfbased-sem-simple-subgraph-any
	rdfbased-sem-simple-emptygraph-self
	rdfbased-ont-graph-permutation
	rdfbased-ont-graph-singleton
	rdfbased-xtr-subgraph-incomplete
	rdfbased-ont-graph-empty
	rdfbased-ont-graph-allsame

- Aside from not generating any inferences, these test cases are already directly supported by our axiom set and will thus always be met:
	rdfbased-sem-class-literal-type
	rdfbased-sem-class-nothing-type
	rdfbased-sem-class-thing-type
	rdfbased-sem-prop-backwardcompatiblewith-type-annot
	rdfbased-sem-prop-comment-type
	rdfbased-sem-prop-deprecated-type
	rdfbased-sem-prop-incompatiblewith-type-annot
	rdfbased-sem-prop-isdefinedby-type
	rdfbased-sem-prop-label-type
	rdfbased-sem-prop-priorversion-type-annot
	rdfbased-sem-prop-seealso-type
	rdfbased-sem-prop-versioninfo-type

- To the best of our knowledge, these test cases are not covered by the current OWL2 RL ruleset, and were thus left out:
	rdfbased-xtr-metamodel-class-sameiff
	rdfbased-xtr-metamodel-prop-sameiff
	rdfbased-xtr-constraint-anonind-axioms
	rdfbased-xtr-subgraph-monotonic
	rdfbased-xtr-reflection-selfsame
